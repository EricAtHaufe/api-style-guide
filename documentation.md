##Documentation

An API needs a proper documentation to help developers to use the API.

It is important to have a readable and meaningful summary about the purpose of the API.

The description should provide a verbose explanation of the operation behavior including  important use cases to give developers a quick headstart.

Goal is to enable a developer to use your API as quick as possible.

- Enable a developer in 5 minutes to use your API
- Documentation is non-negotiable!

Use **Swagger** as description and definition language of your API.
Use **Swagger** to create API reference documentation.

Generating a API description from code can give you a head start, but it cannot replace a proper description.

Use an API Management  to allow developers to get familar and to test your API.
